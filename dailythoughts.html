    <h1>Daily Thoughts</h1>
    <!--This is the intro of the page-->
    <p>
      Welcome! Here, you will be able to explore my
      brain and gain the knowledge of my thought process.
      Brain is very interesting subject. While we believe
      that we are conscious and logical, most of our daily decision
      is decided my unconsciousness and emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like <strong>diary</strong> or <strong>journal</strong>, I will be write this on daily basis.
      However, it will be more focusing on either changes on my value system
      or innovative ideas rather than simply recording daily events.
      I will be still recording events to show how I got to the certain
      point with an idea but the main focus is the thought process.
